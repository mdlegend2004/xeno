channel-service/app/callback_worker.py — Background retry worker.

Polls pending_callbacks every 30 seconds and retries any callbacks
that failed during the initial delivery simulation.

This mirrors how real message brokers (SQS, Kafka) provide at-least-once
delivery guarantees. For this demo scale, an in-memory list is sufficient.
