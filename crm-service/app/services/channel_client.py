"""
services/channel_client.py — Async HTTP client for the channel service.

Design:
  - Uses httpx.AsyncClient (not requests) so we don't block the event loop.
  - 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s.
    This handles transient network blips without hammering the channel service.
  - Returns a result dict keyed by external_id so the caller can map
    each message to its outcome without re-querying the DB.
  - On total failure after 3 attempts, returns "failed" for that external_id.
    The campaign_service then marks the Communication as failed.
