"""
db/seed.py — Seed 200 customers + 600 orders into the brewco database.

Run from inside crm-service/:
    python -m app.db.seed

Design:
  - Faker locale="en_IN" gives Indian names, phone numbers, emails
    that match the BrewCo coffee chain India context.
  - Orders are weighted toward high purchase_count customers to reflect
    real CRM data skew (loyal customers have more order history).
  - total_spent and purchase_count are recomputed from completed orders
    after all inserts, ensuring derived fields are consistent with raw data.
  - Emails are deduplicated with a set to avoid unique constraint violations.
